We also consulted Mrs. Sudhita Kasturi, a homeschool educator with a background in Chemistry and Biology, to confirm the need for a science educational resource and get feedback on our handbook.

<!--                            is how students can work together with their parents to pursue what they’re truly passionate about, and we want to make it easier to do so.-->
